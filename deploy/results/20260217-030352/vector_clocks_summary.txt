Vector Clock Conflict Detection Results
=========================================
Keys tested: 10
Conflicts detected (>1 version): 10/10
Conflict rate: 100.0%

Methodology:
- Two concurrent PUTs to the same key from different nodes
- No context passed (independent causal chains)
- Expected: vector clocks should detect concurrency and store siblings
- Conflict presence depends on timing: if one write propagates before
  the other arrives, the second write may dominate instead of conflicting
