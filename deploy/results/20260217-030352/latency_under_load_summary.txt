Latency Under Load Results
============================
Background load: 2 concurrent writers x 20 PUTs each
Probe count: 20 GETs per phase

Baseline (no load): min=60 median=66 mean=72.2 p95=177 max=177 stdev=25.1
Under load:         min=61 median=68 mean=67.0 p95=71 max=71 stdev=2.9

Note: Background load is limited by serial grpcurl calls per client.
Real load is ~2 concurrent PUT streams during the under_load phase.
