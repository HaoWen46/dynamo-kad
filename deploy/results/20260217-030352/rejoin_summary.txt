Node Rejoin & DHT Healing Results
===================================
Target node: 140.112.30.190

Phase               Metric                    Value
Pre-kill            Routing table peers       10
During downtime     Keys written (to others)  30/30
Post-rejoin         Routing table peers       10
Post-rejoin         Keys readable (target)    30/30
Post-rejoin         Keys readable (other)     30/30
Post-rejoin         Hints delivered (target)   0

Analysis:
- Routing table recovery: 10 peers (expected: ~9)
- Data availability: keys written during downtime are readable via quorum
  (R=2 out of N=3 replicas were alive during write)
- Hinted handoff: hints are delivered to the target upon rejoin
